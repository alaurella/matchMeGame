####Objective

This game is intended to find the repeated image from a bunch of different 18 ones. There are a bunch of random images that suddenly appear on screen,
and only one of those images are repeated. The player has 20 seconds to find, as soon as possible, the duplicated imagen and click it.
   

##Appropriate use case  

 * The game starts by clicking the Start button.
 * There are 10 different rounds or opportunities where the player has to find the duplicated image.
 * There are 2 tables with 9 images each.
 * Only one image in the first table is repeated in the second one.
 * The score is greater when the player takes less time to click on the duplicated image. 
 * If the user clicks on the wrong image, the score goes down.
 
##Limitations
This version of the game has only the logic for playing it without any graphic design on it, which would be included in a further version. 


##Final note
This application is based on the original board game DOBBLE. 
And It was developed only for pedagogical purposes, but not for profit.
